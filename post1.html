          <p>Mixing traditional Indian music with western has been a thing in India since the time bands like the Indian Ocean came to fame. Though it was not long back, the variety and the standards of modern Indian music have really unfolded. Kailash Kher with his band Kailasa has set an example of successful fusion music in India by his Sufi and folk rocks. 

<p>When it comes to independent music and artists I guess in India we somehow fail to appreciate the crude talent that comes in various forms ranging from creativity like fusions to the depth of the lyrics. I have always wanted to hear something that makes me relate to the lyrics or maybe the melodies that subtly convey emotions. Here are some of the artists and creative cover bands that I personally admire. There’s a good chance you like them.</p>
          <p><h3>Bryden-Parth</h3></p>
          <p>Coming from two entirely different musical backgrounds i.e Western and Indian classical, Bryden and Parth create really mesmerizing music. One of my friends who plays flute once shared with me a video of Parth’s solo flute performance in a live concert which was amazing. Since then I have repeatedly played all of their tracks. The perfect blend of these two types makes their music a treat to the ears.</p>

          <p>Here’s one my favorite medleys by them.</p><br>

            <h3> The Indian Jam Project</h3>

<p>Essentially a cover band, The Indian Jam Project gives a very beautiful Indian makeover to western music and presents an instrumental version of it. The significant use of Sitar and Sarangi in many of their tracks is my favorite part. </p>

<p>Here’s the instrumental cover of the song Hey Jude by The Beatles. I am really in love with this because the moment the first string is plucked there’s something that makes me feel the exact vibe of the song without even the lyrics. It is indeed a masterpiece. 

Some of the songs by The Beatles were influenced by Indian classical style and George Harrison himself being a sitar player taught by Ravi Shankar would have loved this if he were alive. </p>

              <h3>The Greenroom Tapes Collective </h3><p>
Known as The Greenroom Tapes Collective these are friends jamming together, adept at keys, tabla and vocals, paying compliments, and enjoying the whole session. They also cover pakistani songs in their mashups which is great because music is the only platform where people don't fail to love and respect each other beyond the rest of the things. </p><p>This particular mashup covering two really wonderful songs, is near to my heart </p><br>

          <br><p>There are so many more artists like the above who are keeping the classical Indian music alive by trying to create something new. Kudos to all of them!</p>
